# Download Youtube Video
This is a Downloader for Youtube videos. Simply you need install pytube and tkinter:

- Pytube (`pip install pytube`)
- Tkinter (`pip install tkinter`)

Once you have install this, you need exec the script `main.py`, and voil√°.

 This is a practice script, its not my idea.
